This text adventure game Is similar to Temple Run, with a little twist to it. 
This is a simple game devloped in python.

Here are the main things i learnt while developing this game:

Algorithmic thinking,
shallow and deep copies of lists,
control statements,
Function returns,
passing in parameters.
