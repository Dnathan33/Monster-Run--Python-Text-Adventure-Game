This Text Adventure Game Is similar to Temple Run as far as how to play it (Win / Loose) with a little twist to it. 
This game has no graphics!

This is a simple game devloped in python.
It has been a great adventure programming the game!

Utilized while loops, control statements (if/else), passing in parameters,
returning from functions, shallow and deep copies of lists, and algorithmic thinking.
